<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Welcome to my travel page! Iâ€™m Jo, born and raised in Florida 
  but Colombian at heart. At age 29, Iâ€™ve been to over 45 countries
  and 6 continents and hope to continue adding on. Iâ€™ve always been 
  passionate about traveling, cultures, and languages for as long as 
  I can remember. </p>

<p>After 27 years of living in Florida I finally decided it was time
  for a big change! So two years ago I jumped on a plane to France to 
  see what it was like living in a different country and learn a new 
  language and culture. </p>

<p>Now not only have I fallen in love with this beautiful country but 
  I also found the love of my life here! Only took moving to the other 
  side of the world to finally find the oneðŸ˜… And of course one of the 
  best ways to learn a language does indeed turn out to be finding 
  yourself a boyfriend that knows the languageðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>I hope to share all my travel experiences, tips, and tricks with you 
  all! So follow along for a never ending adventure !</p>
